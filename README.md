Here is some code I'm using to help me track the price of Battlefield 1 over time. There is a script
to pull the best price from GTA.com and store it in a .csv file, and there is a script to graph that
.csv data using matplotlib. On my system cron jobs set up to update the .cvs at the top over every
hour, and generate a new graph .png in my home directory 1 minute later.
